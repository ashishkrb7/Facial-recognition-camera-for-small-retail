## Motivation
**["According to Gartner, by 2020, 85% of customer interactions in the retail industry will be managed by AI"](https://www.promero.com/archive-press-release/gartner-artificial-intelligent-bots-oracle-bots/)**

## Project description
<div align="center"><img src="./ReadmeImage/Project.png"></div>

### <u>Problem statement</u> 
There is a need for facial recognition cameras. Customer cameras are basic cameras and they want the ability for them to scan face automatically in a crowd of people (like restaurant and bar). So, the camera must scan faces in the crowd and recognize them in a database that they can then have access to and be able to add notes to.

### Technology planned to implement
- **Python**                  : For AI modeling
- **AWS**                     : Storage and hosting
- **Flutter**                 : Mobile application development
- **IOT(Raspberry Pi)**       : For demonstration
