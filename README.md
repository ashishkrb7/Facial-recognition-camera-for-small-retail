### <u>Problem statement</u> 
There is the need for facial recogination cameras. Customer cameras are basic cameras and they want the ability for them to scan face automatically in a croud of people (like restaurant and bar).
So, the camera must scan faces in the crowd and recognize them in a database that they can then have access to and be able to add notes to.
